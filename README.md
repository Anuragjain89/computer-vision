# Computer Vision

As humans, our brain continously processes a multitude of signals received by our retina.

Now, imagine if we could achieve a fraction of this computation on images / high-dimensional data via computers.

###### Computer Vision is the branch of science which allows you to achieve this via image processing, machine learning and mathematical algorithms.
